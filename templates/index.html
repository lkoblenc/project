			<h3> How many apples are in 6 cups?</h3>

			<h3> What are the best apples to use in pies? </h3>

			<p> In the Taste of Home Test Kitchen, we prefer using Granny Smith for pies because of its tart flavor and ability to hold its shape. If you want something with a little more sweetness, we recommend using Braeburn, Golden Delicious or Jonagold. Learn more about the best apples for apple pie to determine which is the best one for you!</p>

			<h3> How do you keep the bottom of a pie from getting soggy? </h3>

			<p> To avoid a pie bottom from getting soggy, allow the bottom crust to heat more rapidly than the rest of the pie. To do this, place a baking sheet in the oven while preheating and then bake your pie on the pan. </p>

			<h3> Is it better to bake a pie in glass or metal? </h3>

			<p> Both metal and glass pie plates work well for baking double-crust pies. But for single-crust pies that are pre-baked, a metal plate is preferred because it heats quicker and ensures a crisp crust. Follow our other pie baking tips in our ultimate pie baking guide! </p>
